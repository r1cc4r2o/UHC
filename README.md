<em>The figures show the separation of proteins that do different things in the latent space. Once the network has been trained to perform a downstream task. The learned latent space captures the details and characteristics of what the protein does. I used different colours to characterise different proteins for which we have statistical evidence that they have similar functions. Because of the sequence similarity. The figures are shown in this order: `img-clusters-token.png`; `img-clusters-nn.EMBEDDING.png`; `img-clusters-ESM2.png`. I discuss the results figures in more detail in the [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VLPiCDF7ntZ2c0Nc70Fu9qHq1o7pIpS/view?usp=sharing).</em>

## Installation

I report here the file to create a conda environment with all the requirements.

``` bash
conda create --name <env-name> --file ./requirements.txt
```

Then, you can activate the environment with:

``` bash

```

### Dataset

I release the data used in the experiments in a [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IRZZGuC8f9lrTxA5k1fG8uOUA58Tkkym?usp=sharing). The structure of the folder is the following:

Concerning the `human_gene_go_term` I retrieved the go term of almost 20000 human gene. Additionally, I have the pre-computed embedding of them obtainded using [ProtBERT](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199554v3). The latent representation of them is available [residue-per-residue](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/contrib/UniProt/embeddings/current_release/UP000005640_9606/per-residue.h5) or [per-protein](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/embeddings/UP000005640_9606/per-protein.h5). In order to facilitate further investigations, I found the precomputed embedding [per-protein](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/embeddings/uniprot_sprot/per-protein.h5) of the entire Swiss-Prot database. In the corresponding notebook, in the folder `experiments`, you can find the code to extract the embedding.

Additionally, in the folders you can find also jupyter-notebooks with the architectures and the models checkpoints. The moldels checkpoints are available also here under the folder `experiments > model_ckpt`.

## Usage

In the folder `experiments`, you can find scripts and juptyer notebooks to run the experiments. The jupyter notebooks are self-explanatory. In the file `module.py` inside the folder `experiments`, you can find the functions implemented to preprocess the data. In separate files you can find the architecture implemented in each version. Inside the `experiments` folder you will find an additional short description for each file.

The folder `img`, contains the images of the cross-weighting block and the architecture proposed in the discussion of the paper. Additionally, you can find the images of the results of the experiments. Specifically, the images are the following:
- `img-crossweighting.png`: the [cross-weighting block](https://github.com/r1cc4r2o/UHC/blob/main/img/img-crossweighting.png);
- `img-architecture.png`: the [architecture proposed](https://github.com/r1cc4r2o/UHC/blob/main/img/img-architecture.png) in the discussion of the report;
- `img-table-metrics.png`: the [table with the metrics trend](https://github.com/r1cc4r2o/UHC/blob/main/img/img-table-metrics.png);
- `img-clusters-token.png`: the [clusters](https://github.com/r1cc4r2o/UHC/blob/main/img/img-clusters-token.png) obtained by the model using a fixed vocabulary;
- `img-clusters-nn.EMBEDDING.png`: the [clusters](https://github.com/r1cc4r2o/UHC/blob/main/img/img-clusters-nn.EMBEDDING.png) obtained by the model using a learnable vocabulary;
- `img-clusters-ESM2.png`: the [clusters](https://github.com/r1cc4r2o/UHC/blob/main/img/img-clusters-ESM2.png) obtained by the model using the ESM2 embedding;
